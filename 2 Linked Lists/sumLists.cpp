/*
    You have two numbers represented by a linked list, 
    where each node contains a single digit. The digits are
    stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the
    head of the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers
    and returns the sum as a linked list. (You are not allowed to
    "cheat" and just convert the linked list to an integer).

    EXAMPLE:

    Input: (1 -> 7 -> 6) + (5 -> 9 -> 2). That is, 617+295
    Output: 2 -> 1 -> 9, or 912

    FOLLOW UP:

    Suppose the digits are stored in forward order, repeat the above problem.

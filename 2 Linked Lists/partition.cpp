/*
    Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, 
    such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater 
    than or equal to x. (IMPORTANT: the partition element x can appear
    anywhere in the "right partition"; it does not need to appear
    between the left and right partitions. The additional spacing in
    the example below indicates the partition. Yes, the output below is 
    one of many valid outputs!)

    EXAMPLE:
    Input: 3 -> 5 -> 8 -> 10 -> 2 -> 1 [partition=5]
    Output: 3 -> 1 -> 2      ->      10 -> 5 -> 5 -> 8

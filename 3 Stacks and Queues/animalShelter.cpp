/*
    An animal shelter, which holds only dogs and cats, operates on a strictly 
    "first in, first out" basis. People must adopt either the "oldest" (based on
    arrival time) of all animals at the shelter, or they can select whether they
    would prefer a dog or a cat (and will receive the oldest animal of that type).
    They cannot select which specific animal they would like. Create a data structure
    to maintain this system and implement operations such as enqueue, dequeue, deuqueDog,
    and dequeueCat. You may use the built-in LinkedList data structure.
